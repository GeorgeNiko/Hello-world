# Hello-world


#hello i am a developer/coder wannabe! 
#After watching a bit of code which is needed for a working private WoW server on your site, i feel such a noob, i can't even understand a line!
#But i am willing to learn to code  so firstly i can understand a few lines and secondly why not write an entire page of useful code for something useful!
